# Neural-Network

This is my file for a custom built Neural Network.

I built two Neural Networks: - Firstly: I built a Neural Network using an pythonic Object Orientated approach with objects for the Layers, Weights, Neurons and Neural Network. This was to develop my understanding of the Neural Network

    - Secondly: I build a Neural Network using numpy as well as objects for Layer's and Neural Networks.

These Neural Networks use Sigmoid Activation and L2 Loss with Xavier weight initialisation.
